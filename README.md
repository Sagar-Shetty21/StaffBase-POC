# Staffbase – Employee Management System (POC)

This project is a **proof of concept (POC)** for an internal **Employee Management System** called **Staffbase**.  
⚠️ It is **not intended for end-users** — the goal is to **learn, experiment, and explore** modern frontend tooling and practices.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Explore modern frontend development with **React** and **Remix (React Router 7 framework)**.
- Experiment with **SCSS** for modular, maintainable styling.
- Learn **React Hook Form** for robust form handling and validation.
- Practice **unit testing** with **Vitest**.
- Implement **end-to-end testing** with **Playwright**.
- Build accessible UI by following **Accessibility (a11y)** best practices.
- Learn advanced state/data fetching with **TanStack Query**.
